# Alejandro Espinosa-Rada

My name is [Alejandro Espinosa-Rada](https://www.aespinosarada.com) and I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at the [Social Networks Lab in ETH Zürich](https://sn.ethz.ch). Before arriving in Zürich, I did my PhD in Sociology at the [Mitchell Centre for Social Network Analysis](https://www.socialsciences.manchester.ac.uk/mitchell-centre/) at the University of Manchester. Also, I was an adjunct assistant professor in which I taught courses related to social network analysis at the Departments of Sociology ([PUC](https://sociologia.uc.cl) and [UAH](http://sociologia.uahurtado.cl)), the Department of Computer Science ([PUC](https://dcc.ing.puc.cl)), and the Department of History ([USACH](https://www.historia.usach.cl)). 

Main areas of interests: Group Dynamics, Sociology of Social Networks, Sociology of Science and Knowledge/Science of Science/Social Studies of Science and Technology, and Network Modelling.
